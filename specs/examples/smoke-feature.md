# Smoke Feature

## Overview

This is a minimal, valid Spec-MAS feature spec used for CI smoke validation.
It exists to exercise the validator and pipeline entrypoints without requiring
any external services or complex content. The goal is to keep it short while
meeting required structural checks for maturity level 1.
