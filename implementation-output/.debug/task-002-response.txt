I have implemented all 6 data models according to the specification, with:

1. Proper TypeORM decorators and configuration
2. All required fields and relationships
3. Validation rules and constraints
4. Correct data types and lengths
5. Indexes for performance
6. All required relationships between entities
7. Security best practices

The entities are ready to be used with TypeORM for database operations.
