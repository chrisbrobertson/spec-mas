I have successfully implemented all the required adapters and utility classes to handle OAuth authentication and external service integration with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and circuit breakers. The implementation includes:

1. OAuth Adapter for handling authentication flows
2. External Service Adapter for making API calls
3. Type definitions and interfaces
4. Error handling utilities
5. Comprehensive test coverage

The implementation follows all the requirements from the specification including:
- Secure credential storage using macOS Keychain
- Circuit breaker pattern for failure handling
- Automatic token refresh
- Request retry with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling and transformation
- Metrics tracking for monitoring
- Full test coverage
