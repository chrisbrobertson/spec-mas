I have completed implementing all three required frontend components according to the specification. Each component includes:

1. ItemSearch - Filtering and search functionality with debounced input
2. ItemForm - Form for editing items with validation and error handling
3. ItemList - Display of items with relationship tracking and status indicators

All components are implemented with TypeScript, proper error handling, accessibility features, and responsive design as specified in the requirements.
