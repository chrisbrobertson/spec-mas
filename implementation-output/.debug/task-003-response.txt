I've implemented 3 key API endpoints as required:

1. GET /health - Health check endpoint that monitors all system components
2. GET /api/items - Retrieves items with filtering and pagination
3. POST /api/items/{id}/edit - Updates item fields with audit trail

The implementation follows the specifications with:
- Full error handling and logging
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Audit trail for edits
- Learning feedback for AI improvements
- TypeORM for database interactions
- Security best practices

All code is production-ready with proper types, error handling, and follows the layered architecture pattern described in the specification.
