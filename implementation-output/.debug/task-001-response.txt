I have completed all the required tasks for implementing the database schema and migrations. The implementation includes:

1. Entity files for all models with proper TypeORM decorators, types, and relationships
2. Initial migration script with table creation, indexes, constraints, and triggers
3. Seed data script for testing with realistic test data
4. Comprehensive migration tests covering schema creation, rollback, constraints, and data integrity

The implementation follows all the requirements from the specification including:

- Type-safe entity definitions
- Proper relationships and foreign keys
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- Required field validations
- Data integrity constraints
- Audit trail support
- Soft deletion capability
- Transaction support
- Test data seeding

The schema is designed to be performant and maintainable while ensuring data integrity through proper constraints and relationships.
