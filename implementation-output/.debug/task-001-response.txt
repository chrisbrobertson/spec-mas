I have completed all the required tasks for creating the database schemas and migrations. Here's a summary of what was created:

1. Schema file (prisma/schema.prisma): Defines all entities with their fields, relationships, and constraints using Prisma schema.
2. Migration file: Creates the initial database schema with all required tables, indexes, constraints and triggers.
3. Seed file: Provides test data for development environment.
4. Migration tests: Comprehensive tests that verify all database constraints and functionality.

The implementation follows all the requirements from the specification including:
- Data integrity through constraints and validation
- Proper relationships between entities
- Audit trail functionality
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization through appropriate indexes
- Full test coverage
- Support for all required features like priority tracking, relationship mapping, etc.
