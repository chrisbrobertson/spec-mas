This completes the implementation of the database schema and migrations. I've created:

1. Entity classes for all 6 tables with proper decorators, types, and relationships
2. Initial migration script that creates all tables with:
   - Proper column types and constraints
   - Indexes for performance
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Check constraints for data validation 
   - Auto-updating timestamps
3. Seed file with test data covering all tables
4. Comprehensive test suite for the migration

The implementation follows all the requirements from the specification, including:
- Well-normalized schema design
- Proper constraints and validation
- Safe and reversible migrations
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Audit trail capabilities
- Connection pooling configuration
- Security best practices
