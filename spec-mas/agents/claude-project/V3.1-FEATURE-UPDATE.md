# Spec-MAS v3.1 Feature Update

## New Features

This update adds two major capabilities to the Spec-MAS Claude Project:

1. **Architecture Analysis & Spec Splitting Recommendations**
2. **Integrated Syntax Validation Before Completion**

---

## Feature 1: Architecture Analysis & Spec Splitting

### What It Does

Automatically detects when specifications are becoming too large or covering multiple concerns, and provides intelligent recommendations for splitting them into smaller, more focused specifications.

### Why It Matters

- **Reduces Implementation Risk**: Smaller specs are less likely to fail
- **Enables Parallel Development**: Split specs can be worked on simultaneously
- **Improves Quality**: Focused specs are easier to review and test
- **Faster Time to Value**: Can ship incremental features rather than waiting for monolith
- **Better Cost Management**: Smaller specs have more predictable API costs

### How It Works

#### Automatic Monitoring
Throughout the spec creation conversation, Claude now monitors:
- Number of business domains mentioned
- Count of functional requirements
- Data entity complexity
- API endpoint count
- External integrations
- User personas and workflows

#### Detection Triggers
Claude will alert you when:
- **Immediate**: You describe 3+ distinct domains in initial description
- **Progressive**: Functional requirements exceed 12, or other indicators accumulate
- **At validation**: Always checks before marking spec complete

#### Analysis Criteria

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Multiple user personas (3+)
- Many functional requirements (12+)
- Many data entities (8+)
- Many API endpoints (10+)
- Multiple external integrations (3+)
- Multiple workflows (4+)

**Cohesion Indicators:**
- Multiple business domains detected
- Different data lifecycle operations
- Different integration patterns

**Size Metrics:**
- Lines > 700 (warning), > 1000 (critical)
- Words > 3500 (warning), > 5000 (critical)

#### Split Recommendations

When splitting is recommended, Claude provides:
1. **Confidence Level**: How certain the recommendation is
2. **Specific Reasons**: Why splitting is beneficial
3. **Suggested Split**: Concrete proposal for how to divide the spec
4. **Priority**: Which parts to implement first
5. **Dependencies**: How split specs relate to each other

### How to Use It

#### In Claude Conversation

**Command: `/analyze`**
```
User: /analyze

Claude: Let me analyze the architecture of this specification...

**Scope Analysis:**
Total Score: 12/20 (threshold: 10)
Confidence: HIGH

**Detected Indicators:**
• Multiple business domains (3 found): auth, billing, notifications
• Many functional requirements (14 vs threshold 12)
• Multiple integrations (4 vs threshold 3)

**Recommendation:** SPLIT RECOMMENDED

**Proposed Split:**
1. Auth & Access Control - 5 FRs, focus on user management
2. Billing & Payments - 6 FRs, focus on transactions  
3. Notification System - 3 FRs, focus on communications

Would you like detailed guidance on splitting these specs?
```

**Command: `/split`**
```
User: /split

Claude: I'll help you split this specification into focused specs.

**Original Spec: "Customer Management Platform"**

**Split Plan:**

**Spec 1: User Authentication & Authorization**
- Scope: Login, registration, password reset, role management
- FRs: FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-7, FR-8
- Entities: User, Role, Permission
- Priority: HIGH (required for all other features)
- Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks

**Spec 2: Customer Data Management**
- Scope: CRUD for customers, search, import/export
- FRs: FR-4, FR-5, FR-6, FR-9
- Entities: Customer, Address, Contact
- Dependencies: Spec 1 (requires auth)
- Priority: HIGH
- Estimated effort: 1 week

**Spec 3: Customer Communication**
- Scope: Email, SMS, notifications, templates
- FRs: FR-10, FR-11, FR-12
- Entities: Template, MessageLog
- Dependencies: Spec 1, Spec 2
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Estimated effort: 1 week

Would you like me to help you create the first spec (I recommend Spec 1)?
```

#### Via CLI

**Analyze an existing spec:**
```bash
npm run analyze-spec specs/features/my-feature.md
```

**Output example:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SPEC ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Recommendation:** ⚠️  SPLIT RECOMMENDED
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Total Score:** 13.5/20 (threshold: 10)

**Summary:**
The specification "Customer Management Platform" shows signs of being too large
or covering multiple concerns (complexity score: 13.5). Consider splitting it
into smaller, more focused specifications.

**Complexity Indicators:**
  • Multiple business domains: 3 (threshold: 3) [+3.0pts]
  • Many functional requirements: 14 (threshold: 12) [+2.3pts]
  • Multiple external integrations: 4 (threshold: 3) [+4.0pts]
  Total complexity score: 9.3

**Recommendations:**

🔴 **Split by business domain** [HIGH]
   This spec covers 3 distinct business domains: user management, billing, notifications
   *Reason: Different business domains typically have different stakeholders, timelines, and requirements*

🟡 **Split into smaller feature sets** [MEDIUM]
   With 14 functional requirements, consider grouping related requirements
   *Reason: Large requirement sets are harder to implement, test, and maintain*

📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. Review the recommendations above
2. Identify natural boundaries in your specification
3. Create separate spec files for each identified concern
4. Use the template: cp specs/TEMPLATE-STARTUP.md specs/features/new-spec.md
5. Add cross-references between related specs
6. Validate each new spec individually
```

**Save analysis to file:**
```bash
npm run analyze-spec specs/features/my-feature.md --output analysis.txt
```

**JSON output:**
```bash
npm run analyze-spec specs/features/my-feature.md --json
```

### Best Practices

**When to Split:**
- Total analysis score >= 10
- Claude recommends it during conversation
- Spec exceeds 700 lines
- Implementation estimate > 2 weeks
- Multiple distinct business domains

**How to Split:**
1. Identify natural boundaries (domains, workflows, integrations)
2. Ensure each new spec has single, clear purpose
3. Make each spec independently implementable
4. Document dependencies between split specs
5. Add cross-references in YAML front-matter
6. Validate each split spec individually

**Split Granularity:**
- Target: 3-8 FRs per spec
- Target: 400-600 lines per spec
- Target: 1-2 week implementation per spec
- Avoid: Specs with >3 dependencies on other specs

---

## Feature 2: Integrated Syntax Validation

### What It Does

Validates that specifications are syntactically correct and complete before marking them as "agent-ready". Catches common issues like missing sections, incomplete requirements, vague criteria, and placeholder text.

### Why It Matters

- **Prevents Implementation Failures**: Agents can't implement incomplete specs
- **Saves Time**: Catches issues before expensive AI agent execution
- **Ensures Consistency**: All specs meet minimum quality standards
- **Reduces Clarification Loops**: Complete specs = no questions during implementation
- **Improves Success Rate**: Validated specs have much higher implementation success

### How It Works

#### Validation Gates

**G1: Structure & Format**
- YAML front-matter present and valid
- Required metadata fields present
- Section structure matches template

**G2: Content Completeness**
- All required sections populated
- No placeholder text ([TBD], [TODO], etc.)
- Functional requirements have descriptions
- Data model has entities defined

**G3: Testability**
- Functional requirements have validation criteria
- At least 3 deterministic tests defined
- Acceptance criteria present
- Tests have concrete inputs/outputs

**G4: Implementation Readiness**
- Requirements are specific and measurable
- Security section complete
- API contracts defined (if applicable)
- No vague terms ("fast", "user-friendly", etc.)

#### Validation Timing

**During Development (Advisory):**
- Light checks at level transitions
- Warns about missing items
- Non-blocking

**Before Completion (Mandatory):**
- Full validation before marking "complete"
- Must pass to export spec
- Blocking

**User-Requested:**
- Via `/validate` command anytime
- Provides detailed report
- Suggests fixes

### How to Use It

#### In Claude Conversation

**Automatic Validation Before Completion:**
```
User: I think we're done with this spec!

Claude: Let me validate the specification before we finalize it...

🔍 **Running Validation...**

**Structure Check:**
✓ YAML front-matter present and valid
✓ All required sections for Level 4 present

**Content Check:**
✓ No placeholder text found
✓ All 6 FRs have descriptions
✓ Security section complete
✓ Data model has 3 entities defined

**Testability Check:**
✓ 5 deterministic tests defined
✓ All FRs have validation criteria
✓ All tests have concrete inputs/outputs

**Quality Check:**
✓ No vague terms detected
✓ All metrics are specific and measurable
✓ API contracts are complete

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ **VALIDATION PASSED!**

**Readiness Score:** 92/100

This specification is agent-ready and can proceed to implementation!

**Next Steps:**
1. Save as: specs/features/user-auth.md
2. Confirm: npm run validate-spec specs/features/user-auth.md
3. Generate tests: npm run generate-tests specs/features/user-auth.md
4. Implement: npm run implement-spec specs/features/user-auth.md
```

**Manual Validation Check:**
```
User: /validate

Claude: Running comprehensive validation check...

⚠️ **VALIDATION ISSUES FOUND**

**Critical Issues (Must Fix):**

❌ **Missing YAML Field:** 'maturity' is required
   → Add to front-matter: maturity: 4

❌ **Incomplete FR-3:** Missing validation criteria
   → Add at least 2 specific, testable criteria

❌ **Insufficient Tests:** Only 2 deterministic tests (need 3+)
   → Add at least 1 more concrete test with exact inputs/outputs

❌ **Security Section Empty:** Section exists but has no content
   → Must define: auth method, authorization rules, input validation, audit logging

**Warnings (Should Fix):**

⚠️ **Vague NFR:** "Fast response time" is not specific
   → Change to: "Response time < 500ms for 95% of requests"

**Readiness Score:** 65/100 (Need 80+)

**To Fix These Issues:**
Let me help you complete each item. Which would you like to address first?
1. Add maturity field to YAML
2. Complete FR-3 validation criteria
3. Add deterministic tests
4. Fill out security section
5. Make NFRs more specific
```

### Common Validation Failures & Fixes

#### 1. Missing Validation Criteria
```markdown
❌ BEFORE:
### FR-1: User Login
**Description:** Users can log in

✅ AFTER:
### FR-1: User Login
**Description:** Users can log in using email and password

**Validation Criteria:**
- Login form accepts email and password inputs
- Invalid credentials return 401 with error message
- Valid credentials return 200 with auth token
- Token has 1-hour expiry
- Failed attempts are logged
```

#### 2. Vague Deterministic Tests
```markdown
❌ BEFORE:
### DT-1: Login Test
**Input:** Valid credentials
**Expected:** Success

✅ AFTER:
### DT-1: Valid Login
**Input:**
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Pass123!",
  "rememberMe": false
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

**Verification:**
- HTTP Status: 200
- Token is valid JWT
- expiresIn = 3600
```
```

#### 3. Empty Security Section
```markdown
❌ BEFORE:
## Security
[TBD]

✅ AFTER:
## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry
- Roles: Admin (full access), User (own data only)

### Input Validation
- Email: RFC 5322 format, max 255 chars
- Password: Min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol
- All inputs sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS

### Data Protection
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost: 12)
- PII encrypted at rest with AES-256
- HTTPS required for all endpoints

### Audit Logging
Log all: login attempts, password changes, permission changes
```
